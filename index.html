  <h1>Privacy Policy for WExcel</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel processes your WhatsApp chats entirely on your device. When you export a chat or grant notification access, the app reads
    sender names, message text, timestamps, and any attached files <em>only</em> to convert them into Excel sheets. Nothing is uploaded
    to our servers or cloud services. The resulting text or Excel files are written solely to the folder you select via Android’s
    Storage Access Framework, and you can delete them at any time using your file manager.
  </p>

  <h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    Optional one-time purchases (for example, unlocking automatic conversion) are handled securely by Google Play Billing. We do not
    receive or store your payment details; Google processes that information under the
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Inside the app we only keep an encrypted,
    device-local flag to remember whether a feature you bought should stay unlocked.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    - <strong>Folder access (Storage Access Framework):</strong> used solely so you can pick the folder where chats and Excel files are
      read or saved. You control the permission via Android’s system picker and can revoke it whenever you like.<br>
    - <strong>Notification listener (optional):</strong> requested only if you enable automatic capture from WhatsApp notifications.
      It exists purely to convert messages in real time and can be disabled in system settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    WExcel does not include advertising SDKs. Aside from Google Play Billing and standard Android services, we do not integrate other
    analytics or tracking components. Any data Google handles is subject to their own privacy terms.
  </p>

  <h2>4. GDPR (EU/EEA Users)</h2>
  <p>
    Because all WhatsApp data stays on your device, you can exercise most rights (access, deletion, objection) by revoking permissions,
    deleting the generated files, or uninstalling the app. If you reach out to us—for example via support email—we will help with any
    information we might hold outside the app (e.g., correspondence about a purchase).
  </p>

  <h2>5. CCPA & CPRA (California Residents)</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or share personal information. Purchase-related data is handled exclusively by Google Play Billing. You can opt out
    of data collection at any time by revoking permissions or uninstalling WExcel. For questions about any support data we retain,
    contact us using the email below.
  </p>

  <h2>6. CalOPPA</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is always available inside the app and on the store listing. We clearly disclose the permissions we request
    (folder access and notification access) and why we need them. When we make changes, we update the “Last updated” date and describe
    important revisions in the app or listing.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. Parents or guardians can revoke
    notification access, remove folder permissions, or uninstall the app to prevent use.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. Any revisions appear here with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of WExcel
    after the update means you accept the revised policy.
  </p>
