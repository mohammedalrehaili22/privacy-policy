  <h1>Privacy Policy for WExcel</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel processes your WhatsApp chats entirely on your device. When you export a chat or grant notification access, the app reads
    sender names, message text, timestamps, and any attached files <em>only</em> to convert them into Excel sheets. Nothing is uploaded
    to our servers or cloud services. The resulting text or Excel files are written solely to the folder you select via Android’s
    Storage Access Framework, and you can delete them at any time using your file manager.
  </p>

  <h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    Optional one-time purchases (for example, unlocking automatic conversion) are handled securely by Google Play Billing. We do not
    receive or store your payment details; Google processes that information under the
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Inside the app we only keep an encrypted,
    device-local flag to remember whether a feature you bought should stay unlocked.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions, Advertising, and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    - <strong>Folder access (Storage Access Framework):</strong> used solely so you can pick the folder where chats and Excel files are
      read or saved. You control the permission via Android’s system picker and can revoke it whenever you like.<br>
    - <strong>Notification listener (optional):</strong> requested only if you enable automatic capture from WhatsApp notifications.
      It exists purely to convert messages in real time and can be disabled in system settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Advertising:</strong> WExcel uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob and its partners may collect and process personal data such as your
    device's Advertising ID, IP address, and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, measure ad performance, and prevent fraud.
    Google's use of this data is governed by the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from Google Play Billing, AdMob, and standard Android services, we do not integrate other analytics or tracking components.
  </p>

  <h2>4. GDPR (EU/EEA Users)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Advertising Consent:</strong> We use the <strong>Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK</strong> to manage user consent for advertising in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK.
    Upon launching the app, users in these regions will be presented with a consent form to accept or manage their preferences regarding data collection
    for personalized ads. You can update your preferences at any time by reinstalling the app to reset the consent state.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>App Data:</strong> Because all WhatsApp data stays on your device, you can exercise most rights (access, deletion, objection) by revoking permissions,
    deleting the generated files, or uninstalling the app. If you reach out to us—for example via support email—we will help with any
    information we might hold outside the app (e.g., correspondence about a purchase).
  </p>

  <h2>5. CCPA & CPRA (California Residents)</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. However, we work with third-party advertising partners (Google AdMob) who may collect identifiers
    (like your Advertising ID) to serve ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads > Delete advertising ID).
    Purchase-related data is handled exclusively by Google Play Billing.
  </p>

  <h2>6. CalOPPA</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is always available inside the app and on the store listing. We clearly disclose the permissions we request
    (folder access and notification access) and why we need them. When we make changes, we update the “Last updated” date and describe
    important revisions in the app or listing.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. Parents or guardians can revoke
    notification access, remove folder permissions, or uninstall the app to prevent use.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. Any revisions appear here with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of WExcel
    after the update means you accept the revised policy.
  </p>
