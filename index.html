  <h1>Privacy Policy for WExcel</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not transmit your personal data to our servers or cloud services. When you grant storage or notification permissions,
    WExcel processes WhatsApp chat content locally on your device to convert it into Excel files. This processing may include
    sender names, message text, timestamps, and any attachments present in the exported chat. The resulting text and Excel files
    are stored only in the folder you choose (for example, Downloads) and remain under your control. You can delete them at any time
    using your device’s file manager.
  </p>

  <h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel offers optional one-time in-app purchases (such as unlocking automatic conversion). All purchases are processed securely
    through the Google Play Store via Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store your payment or billing information; Google
    handles that data under the
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    We only keep a local flag to know whether the feature you bought should be enabled on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app requests access to read/write external storage—including <code>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>—so it can open exported
    WhatsApp chats and save the converted Excel files. It may also request notification-listener access when you enable automatic
    capture from WhatsApp notifications. These permissions are used solely for the conversion features and can be revoked from your
    system settings at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current release does not include advertising SDKs such as Google AdMob, and we do not run ads. Aside from Google Play Billing
    (for purchases) and standard Android system services, we do not integrate other third-party analytics or tracking tools.
    Any data handled by Google is subject to their own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>4. GDPR (EU/EEA Users)</h2>
  <p>
    Users in the EU/EEA have rights to access, correct, delete, or object to processing of personal data. Because WExcel processes
    WhatsApp content entirely on your device and does not send it to our servers, most of these rights can be exercised directly by
    revoking permissions, deleting the generated files, or uninstalling the app. If you contact us, we will assist with any data we
    might hold outside the app (such as support emails or purchase inquiries).
  </p>

  <h2>5. CCPA & CPRA (California Residents)</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel does not sell or share personal information. Any purchase-related information is handled by Google Play Billing in line
    with Google’s policies. You can opt out of data collection by disabling the relevant permissions or uninstalling the app.
    If you need help regarding data from support interactions, contact us using the email below.
  </p>

  <h2>6. CalOPPA</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is available within the app and on the store listing at all times. We disclose the permissions requested
    (storage access and notification access) and why we need them. When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and
    describe the key modifications in the app or listing.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    WExcel is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. Parents or guardians
    can revoke notification access, remove storage permissions, or uninstall the app to prevent use by children.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will appear here with a new “Last updated” date, and we will
    highlight significant changes where required. Continuing to use WExcel after an update means you accept the revised policy.
  </p>
